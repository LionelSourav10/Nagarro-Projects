It is Ash's fifth and one of his strongest Pokémon, winning some of his most difficult battles.Charizard as a Charmander was loyal, to the point of being naive; he believed that his trainer, Damian, would come back for him. However, upon discovering the truth that Damian is a selfish person, he rejected him as his trainer and became one of Ash's Pokémon, knowing that Ash was dedicated, selfless, and an all-around better trainer than Damian after he saved his life. He shows the same loyalty and respect towards Ash that he once had for Damian, and he also became happier as well.</em></p>

After he started bonding with Ash, Gengar became much friendlier and became more relaxed, although he still retained his mischievous streak.</em></p>

            <h2><b><em><u>Misty</u></em></b></h2>
            <p><em>Misty is a character who premiered in the first episode of Pokémon the Series.
                In the first episode, she meets Ash after fishing him out of a lake while he was trying to get away from a flock of Spearow. Ash then takes Misty's bike from her in order to escape the Spearow which is then inadvertently wrecked by Pikachu's Thunder Shock. Misty then tracks down Ash and follows him around on his adventures until he can pay her back, although she eventually forgets about the bike and becomes one of Ash's closest friends in the process. However, at the end of their journey through the Johto Region, Misty's bike has been completely repaired, and she leaves to return home to Cerulean City to resume her duties as a Gym Leader.
                
                She is currently the Cerulean City Gym Leader, a position she took over from her older sisters.</em></p>

Starmie is used more for transport than for battle, often carrying Misty across water, although it is unknown if it is capable of actually using Surf (in the anime, a Pokémon does not need to know Surf in order to carry their trainer across water).</em></p>

When it Mega Evolves, it changes into a Water/Dark-type Pokémon.In its debut appearance after evolving from Magikarp, Gyarados was seen as an ill-tempered Pokémon with uncontrollable rage similar to James' Gyarados from the episode, Pokémon Shipwreck!. It was demonstrated when he was out of control, such as scaring Misty's other Water Pokémon beneath the pool, and like Ash's Charizard, he hits Misty several times with Hydro Pump, just like how Charizard hits Ash's face from its Flamethrower, and Misty did her best to tame it despite her fear of it since she was a child.</em></p>
